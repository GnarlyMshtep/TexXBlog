# Hyde's Heiku. 
My first posts must be dedicated to the ancient $japanese$ art of rhyme, often told to $\epsilon{}$ starting from a young age. Here is a personal favorite, orginating all the way from teh great $70^s$ show. 

"I'm gonna explain my feelings to you through a highly disciplined form of Japanese poetry - haiku:

#### My heart aches with pain
#### When I see you, I vomit
#### Die away from me"
